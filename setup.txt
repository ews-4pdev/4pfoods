MyStack Setup and Testing
----------------------------------------------

1.	Create a MySQL database called [database]
2.	In the /ormroot directory, edit build.properties and runtime-conf.xml with DB info
3.	From the /ormroot directory, run go.sh to set up the database - there should be no errors
4.  Mount a virtual host on /webroot and open in your browser
		(i)		The top heading should say "Welcome to MyStack, Robin Arenson!" - indicating the DB works
		(ii)	Click the first "Click me" link to test that the JS engine is working  with BUILD mode off (SOURCE mode on)
		(iii)	Click the second "Click me" link to test that the Ajax engine is working with BUILD mode off (SOURCE mode on)
		(iv)	Switch BUILD mode on by editing the value of JS_BUILD in /application/config/rconfig.php
		(v)		Run tests (ii) and (iii) again to make sure the JS and Ajax engines work in BUILD mode
