												Hi [firstname],<br><br>
												
												Welcome! Thanks for joining the 4P Foods Community; we are so happy to have you on board!<br><br>
                  
                        Here's what you need to know to get started. Please do read through this whole email... we promise, it’s helpful stuff!  If you’re already a member and just added your protein share, be sure to read the logistics included here since the meat share is a tiny bit different than the produce share you’re used to.<br><br>  
                        
                        <b>1)</b> We will email you three times a week. Once letting you know what to expect in your bag, once reminding you to drop off your bag from the previous week, and lastly after we leave your building letting you know that, "Your bag has been delivered!"<br>
                        <b>2)</b> Bags are delivered to the concierge/security desk in your building (unless we inform you otherwise) and should be picked up as soon as possible after receiving the notification email that your bag has arrived.<br>
                        <b>3)</b> Now that your account is active, your first bag is coming in our very next shipment to your building. (Unless that shipment is within 48 hours from now, at which point we need to bump your first bag to next week…bummer, we know, but we promise it’ll be worth the wait)<br>
                        <b>4)</b> Your credit card will be charged on the 1st of each month. The amount will be based on the number of deliveries you received the month prior.<br>
                        <b>5</b> The meat will be delivered frozen in insulated tote bags with a small, collapsible cooler box inside.  They’ll keep your meat cold and fresh all day long until you get home.  They’re designed to be easy for all of our public transport commuters out there.  That said, they’re not cheap.  We operate on the honor system to get our supplies back so please (PRETTY PLEASE) return them to us when we are scheduled to come to your building for your next delivery.  It will help us out a lot, and we will sanitize and reuse them so as to keep our carbon footprint as small as possible.<br><br>  
                        
                        <em>- Important Note About Our Meats and Eggs –</em><br><br>
                        All of our meat and eggs come from small scale, local farmers using sustainable agricultural practices that we have been careful to select over the past year.  These are farmers that take their role as stewards of the land and their animals very seriously.  Much of it will be certified organic and certified humane.  Those that don’t have the certifications are likely using the same practices, but they may be too small or too new.  If you ever have questions about how your meat is raised and processed, we have an open invitation policy with all of our farm partners – you are welcome to visit any of our farms anytime to see exactly how it’s done.  Just ask us and we’ll coordinate it.  These are happy animals, being raised in ways that help rebuild the soil and the health of the farm around them.  We’ll be doing farm tours each season, so if you don’t want to go on your own field trip, be sure to join us for one of ours to see where (and from whom) your food comes from.<br><br>
                        
                        Remember:<br><br>
                        
                        · If you ever want to skip/pause a certain week, you simply login to your account and click “Skip,” then enter the dates you’ll be out of town or want to skip. Just be sure to do this before the 48-hour shut out window when we have already placed our order with our farmers for the week. Sunday at 11:59 PM to skip Wednesday deliveries, Monday at 11:59 PM for Thursday deliveries, and so on.<br>
                        · If you ever want to change your share size (no eggs, more eggs, etc.) you can do so at any time.<br>
                        · Keep the feedback coming! We are always open to hearing suggestions on how we can improve.<br><br>
                        
                        Thanks again for supporting us, your local farmers, and your local neighbors. Your food dollars are now well at work to create a more sustainable, equitable food system for the future. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to contact Amber (copied on this email), our Director of Food Communities. She’s pretty awesome.<br><br>
                        
                        Good stuff!<br><br>
                        
                        - Tom, Amber, & the 4P Foods Family<br>
